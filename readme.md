# SAP EAM 2019

## About

This repository contains the files I use to pull reports and build an interactive calendar allowing me to update SAP.

## Open Source

This is the full application. For obvious reasons I couldn't open source the entire project, but these core files are what I use to build the API I presented as well as the queries I use inside and outside of the application. You will find comments and other items as this is not a formal commercial product.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

This is open source and as such, I make no promises what-so-ever if this will work for you. Pleas read the MIT license.
